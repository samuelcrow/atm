# ATM Project  
## ATM Description  
This is a simple project that I made through the MIT | xPro course.  It demonstrates our abilities to create a fully functional atm application.  The projects has two options, a deposite and withdraw.  You can add as much money into your account as you'd like, but you can only withdraw the amount that is currently in your account.
